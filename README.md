This is about "data structure".
All codes are regarding to data structure.

stack_merge_1
: merge two stacks then make new stack. but only use push and pop
: two stacks are {0,1,2,3,4} and {5,6,7,8,9}
: first put {0,1,2,3,4}, and then put {5,6,7,8,9}
: after push, get a new stack which is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
: pop from 9 to 0


stack_merge_2
: merge two stacks then make new stack. but only use push and pop
: same as stack_merge_1, but need to get different result
: first two stacks are {0,1,2,3,4} and {5,6,7,8,9}
: push each elements by turns
: after push, get a new stack which is {0,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9}
: pop from 9 to 0
