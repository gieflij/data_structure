# Data_structure

This is about "data structure".
All codes are regarding to data structure class.
Some parts of the codes are from the class.

## stack_merge_1
: merge two stacks then make new stack. but only use push and pop
- two stacks are {0,1,2,3,4} and {5,6,7,8,9}
- first put {0,1,2,3,4}, and then put {5,6,7,8,9}
- after push, get a new stack which is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
- pop from 9 to 0


## stack_merge_2
: merge two stacks then make new stack. but only use push and pop
- same as stack_merge_1, but need to get different result
- first two stacks are {0,1,2,3,4} and {5,6,7,8,9}
- push each elements by turns
- after push, get a new stack which is {0,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9}
- pop from 9 to 0

# SoC_programming

This is about "Soc programming".
All codes are regarding to the class and programmed for it.
Programming language is verilog.

## baseball_game
: project for the class.
- using TEXTLCD, LED, 7-SEGMENT, TXTLCD, BUTTONS 


## HW (numbers)
: homeworks for the class
  - some parts of the codes are from class pdf
  - some parts of the codes are for homeworks


## studying verilog (numbers)
: studying verilog in the class

: some basics regarding to "fundamentals of logic design"

: most of the codes are from the textbook and pdf

: some parts of the codes are for homeworks


# Information_theory

This is about "Information theory".
All codes are regarding to it.
The codes are programmed in the MATLAB.


## huffman coding (numbers)
: programming Huffman coding algorithm as an project
- more common symbols are generally represented using fewer bits than less common symbols
- using bits as less as you can
- if you try, you can get queues as the results
- you can get 3 cases as maximum


## channel coding (numbers)
: programming encoder and decoder as an progject

- encoder
  - shift registers
-  decoder
  -  viterbi algorithm
