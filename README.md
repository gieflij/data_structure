# data_structure

This is about "data structure".
All codes are regarding to data structure.

stack_merge_1
: merge two stacks then make new stack. but only use push and pop
: two stacks are {0,1,2,3,4} and {5,6,7,8,9}
: first put {0,1,2,3,4}, and then put {5,6,7,8,9}
: after push, get a new stack which is {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
: pop from 9 to 0


stack_merge_2
: merge two stacks then make new stack. but only use push and pop
: same as stack_merge_1, but need to get different result
: first two stacks are {0,1,2,3,4} and {5,6,7,8,9}
: push each elements by turns
: after push, get a new stack which is {0,5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9}
: pop from 9 to 0

# SoC programming

This is about "Soc programming".
All codes are regarding to it and programmed in the class.
Programming language is verilog.

baseball_game
: project for the class.
: using TEXTLCD, LED, 7-SEGMENT, TXTLCD, BUTTONS 

HW (numbers)
: homeworks for the class

studying verilog (numbers)
: studying verilog for the class
: some basics regarding to "fundamentals of logic design"

# information theory

This is about "Information theory"
All codes are regarding to it.
The codes are programmed in the MATLAB.


huffman coding (numbers)
: programming Huffman coding algorith
: more common symbols are generally represented using fewer bits than less common symbols
: using bits as less as you can
: if you try, you can get queues as the results
: you can get 3 cases as maximum

channel coding (numbers)
: programming encoder and decoder
: encoder - shift registers
: decoder - viterbi algorithm
: in <computation
